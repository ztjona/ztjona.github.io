You can also visit my profile on our [lab's website](https://laboratorio-ia.epn.edu.ec/en/members/m_members-active/31-msc-jonathan-zea).

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD on AI Mechanistic Interpretability.
My areas of interest include Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Algorithms, and the intersection of AI and Philosophy.

In a broader context, I am passionate about microcontrollers, embedded systems, robotics and technology.

Beyond that, I am also interested about literature, climate change, puzzles and board games.
